Anya decided to embark on a journey to spread joy to all corners of the world. She traveled through forests, over mountains, and across rivers. She sang songs to the birds, danced with the bears, and told jokes to the frogs. People smiled brighter, laughed louder, and danced more freely when Anya was around.

Anya started by singing a song to a group of children playing in a park. The children were so delighted that they started to sing and dance along. Soon, the entire park was filled with people singing and dancing. She organized a parade of people dressed in colorful costumes. She led a sing-along in the town square.
